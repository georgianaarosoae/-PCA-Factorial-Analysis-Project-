## Population Analysis of Occupied Population at County Level in Romania

This project focuses on analyzing the occupied population across counties in Romania using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factorial Analysis.

### Introduction
Understanding the distribution and characteristics of the occupied population within different regions of Romania is crucial for various socio-economic studies and policymaking. This project employs PCA and Factorial Analysis to delve into the underlying patterns and relationships among demographic variables at the county level.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, normalize data, and ensure consistency across variables.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is applied to identify the principal components that explain the variance within the dataset. This helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining essential information about the population structure.
3. **Factorial Analysis**: Factorial Analysis is conducted to explore the interrelationships among different demographic variables and uncover latent factors influencing the population distribution across counties.
